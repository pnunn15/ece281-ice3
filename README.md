Targeted toward Digilent Basys3. Make sure to install the [board files](https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore/tree/2018.2/boards/Digilent/basys3).

Tested on Vivado 2018.2.

## GitHub Actions Testbench

You can *optionally* enable Actions on your fork.

The workflow uses the [setup-ghdl-ci](https://github.com/ghdl/setup-ghdl-ci) GitHub action
to run a *nightly* build of [GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/).

First, the workflow uses GHDL to **analyze** all `.vhd` files in `src/hdl/`.

Then it **elaborates** the *any* entity with the name `*_tb`.

Finally, the workflow **runs** the simulation. If successful then it will quietly exit with a `0` code.
If any of the `assert` statements fail **with** `severity failure` then GHDL will cease the simulation and exit with non-zero code; this will also cause the workflow to fail.
Assert statements of other severity levels will be reported, but not fail the workflow.

## Documentation
C3C Alex sick helped me fix my concurrent statement in top_basys3.vhd. In the testbench, he helped me to avoid errors by initializing my signals to zero. He also helped me realize to use a truth table for filling in the assert statements. He helped me to fix the simulation sources by adding the top_basys3.vhd to top module and including the rest as well as halfadder.vhd.
